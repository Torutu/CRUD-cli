# CRUD-cli
A simple and efficient CRUD application built with Go, designed specifically to manage library data such as visitors and books. It offers basic commands to add, update, search, rent, and return books, providing a practical tool for handling everyday library operations with ease.
 This project helped me learn and practice key Go concepts such as:

- Working with structs and slices

- Handling user input and output

- Basic file operations for data persistence

Building this app was a great way to strengthen my understanding of Go by creating a real-world command-line tool.
